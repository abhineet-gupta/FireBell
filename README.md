`FireBell` is a system comprising an Android app and a smart fire hazard sensor. The app retrieves sensor data from nearby systems and informs users of potential danger - both before and during a fire.

The sensing system senses presence of smoke, carbon monoxide levels and temperature, and then logs this data to a server in the _Azure_ cloud. The companion app then retrieves this data from sensors in the proximity of a user's location, and informs them of any concerning situations.
<br>
The app can also be used to read local fire news or make an emergency call.

The FireBell system thus helps prevent mistakes of the past by tracking the present to `enable active decision-making for a safer future`.
